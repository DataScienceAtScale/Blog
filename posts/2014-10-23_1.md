I've updated the tutorial that I gave at OSU on beginner Python
and using numpy and matplotlib.

You can find the updated version on 
[github](https://github.com/DataScienceAtScale/python-at-osu-oct-10).

Thanks to 
[Han-Wei Shen](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~hwshen/hwshen/Welcome.html), 
his [students](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~hwshen/hwshen/Research.html), and
[Tom Peterka](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~tpeterka/) for attending, 
and helping me to prepare for the
[Visualization](http://ieeevis.org/) tutorial coming up in a few weeks.
