I love Python. I've basically done all of my research in Python since
2001 or so, and recently I'm becoming a Python evangelist (though,
Python does have its drawbacks, like I wish it had pattern matching,
better support for immutable data so you could compile it (like
Haskell and F#), type inference for the same reason, better syntax 
for partial functions, etc... But I digress.)

Keeping with my recent evangelism,
I'll be at Ohio State, IEEE Vis 2014, and SIAM CSE 2015 this year teaching
Python for Visualization and Analysis tutorials with colleagues of mine at
Continuum Analytics, Kitware, and Indiana University.
