After starting to implement some of these 
[queries](#Example-SQL-Queries-on-HPC-Simulation-Data), I started
running into the problem that 
[MPAS](http://mpas-dev.github.io/ocean/ocean.html) doesn't have a regular
grid. In particular, it has a Voronoi tesselated grid, which means
when you do integrations (or averages), this becomes a problem:
`select avg(u), avg(v), y, z group by x`.  

How do you group
by *x*, when every *x* is unique? In particular, the *xs* are floating point
data and don't line up exactly. *Group bys* are going to difficult, 
and we have seen this before in our experiments with 
[bitmap indices on floating point data](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-014-0360-5).

A first solution looks like we need to quantize the values we want to group by.
This is what we do in the bitmap indicies, as floating point values
get quantized.
A better solution likely involes doing an actual integration with a kernel of
some stencil size with discrete *x* values, and searching for the cells
that sit under the kernel. 

Though, that second method doesn't necessarily work well in a SQL
language. For now, lets just go with the first solution, because it
fits a SQL query better.
