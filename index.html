<p>Extremely large datasets and extremely high-rate data streams are becoming increasingly common due to the operation of Moore&apos;s Law as applied to sensors, embedded computing, and traditional high-performance computing. Interactive analysis of these datasets is widely recognized as a new frontier at the interface of information science, mathematics, computer science, and computer engineering. Text searching on the web is an obvious example of a large dataset analysis problem; however, scientific and national security applications require far more sophisticated interactions with data than text searches. These applications represent the &apos;data to knowledge&apos; challenge posed by extreme-scale datasets in, for example, astrophysics, biology, climate modeling, cyber security, earth sciences, energy security, materials science, nuclear and particle physics, smart networks, and situational awareness. In order to contribute effectively to Los Alamos National Lab&apos;s overall national security mission, we need a strong capability in Data Science at Scale. This capability rests on robust and integrated efforts in data management and infrastructure, visualization and analysis, high-performance computational statistics, machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and information exploitation. The Data Science at Scale capability provides tools capable of making quantifiably accurate predictions for complex problems with the efficient use and collection of data and computing resources.</p>

<p><em>October 2, 2014</em></p>
<p>This is a visualization of ocean temperature, in degrees Celsius, from the MPAS-Ocean Model, developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The goal of the visualization is to enable detailed views of the eddies and currents in specific regions of the model. The color map developed allows for a detailed rendering of specific data ranges. The image of the North Atlantic shows that the Gulf Stream departs the US coast at Cape Hatteras, NC, and turns left just south of Greenland, a feature known as the &apos;Northwest Corner&apos;. This pathway compares well with observations, and is highlighted by a narrow range of greens on the colormap. In the western Pacific, the Kuroshio current is a narrow stream of warm water that sheds eddies as it departs eastward from Japan. The colormap was chosen to use light yellow at 22C at the center of the jet, highlighting cooler eddies to the north in blue and warmer eddies to the south in green. It was produced by Francesca G. Samsel of the Center for Agile Technologies at the University of Texas at Austin and Mark Petersen of the Climate, Ocean, Sea Ice Modeling Team at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
