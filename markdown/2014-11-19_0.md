I recently came across several tools to be able to do functional
programming in Python. The ones in particular I am looking at are
[fn](https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py) and 
[toolz](http://toolz.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html).
These extend a lot of the functionality that's already found in
[functools](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html) and 
[itertools](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html).
(Though, Guido has said Python was always intended to be an imperative
language and the functional stuff was never his personal agenda. This
is why *reduce* is deprecated because he thinks it is unreadable compared
to a *for* loop. I'm paraphrasing here.)

So, why do this (aside from functional programming is a lot of 
fun in an academic way)? Because, it makes filtering and processing
of data pretty easy. In particular, joins, group by, filters (all
found in *SQL*) are very functional paradigms for data selection.

You ask, "why not just use *pandas*?" ([pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/))
"(or even *numpy* because you can do most of the *pandas* stuff in numpy?)" 
"It can do all of the filtering, joining, and data massaging that you'd
like to do." Well, its because *pandas* is currently memory only, and frequently
our data sets are larger than the memory that you are currently running
on. (As an aside, you can back *numpy* arrays with memory maps, to do
out-of-core processing. It's really fast and transparent.) 

Out-of-core (streaming) maps really well to a functional lazy
evaluation model, like Python generators. The aforementioned functional tools 
utilize on Python's lazy iterator/generator model and can be used
to process data out-of-core really easily. Plus, we have other work
going on that uses the vector/streaming/functional model for computation, found
in [Piston](http://viz.lanl.gov/projects/PISTON.html).

Though, I am keeping tabs on [blaze](http://blaze.pydata.org). It's not quite 
where I'd like it, yet, (and being able to use it without Anaconda), 
but maybe it's the out-of-core *pandas* we'd like to have, someday.
(In the same vein, someday I may be using [julia](http://julialang.org/), too.)
