Recently, while working with some databases, 
I was trying to come up with some examples
of what a scientific workload might look like in a database.

This is because our typical workflow uses things other than
databases, like flat binary
files (hopefully column-major, though sometimes our scientists
do row-major), HDF5, NetCDF, VTK XML, etc. In rare circumstances,
they sometimes come in a text file. 

Imagine the data management
nightmare going from: supercomputer, to parallel file system, to 
tape drives, and back again to do any analysis. It's slow, cumbersome
and a pain to manage a large-scale scientific data set in this way,
because I/O is always the bottleneck nowadays and it wastes
scientist time to move the data around from all the different
storage systems.  So a lot of my interest is trying to bring SQL 
(and the different implementations of it) as a DSL (domain specific language)
to subset, slice-and-dice, and query HPC data.

These are just some example queries I might imagine on
an MPAS-O ocean dataset, if they were stored in a SQL-like storage 
system, off the top of my head:

- `select avg(temp), avg(salt) group by month`
- `select avg(u), avg(v), y, z group by x`
- `select avg(u) * avg(u) + avg(v) * avg(v), y, z group by x`
- `select avg(temp), avg(salt) where month = 4`
- `select avg(temp), avg(salt) where month = 4 and z = 0`
- `select x, y, avg(u), avg(v), avg(salt), avg(temp) where month = 4 and z = 0 and x > 1300 and x < 1500 and y > 1300 and y < 1500 group by x, y`
- `select x, y, salt where temp > 20 and z = 0`
- `select x, y, salt where temp < 0 and z = 0`
- `select x, y, salt where temp < 0 and z > 0`
- `select avg(salt), avg(temp) group by week `
- `select x, y, salt, temp where sqrt(u*u + v*v) > 50 and z = 0`
