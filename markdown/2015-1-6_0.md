Or don't bind methods to data.

So, investigating some ways to introduce filter/select into various
languages, a colleague of mine and I both agree we don't like how 
Pandas and now Blaze is going to do it in Python. 
It looks too much like array syntax and filter and select are "hidden".

```python
data[filterexpr, selectexpr][filterexpr, selectexpr]
```

Then, he brought up he prefers the R/dplyr syntax, which I agree with:

```R
data %>% filter(expr) %>% select(expr) %>% filter(expr) %>% select(expr)
```

And gave the example of how scala does it and looks very similar
to pynq and asq for python:

```python
data.filter(expr).select(expr).filter(expr).select(expr)
```

Though, I don't like that one. This assumes the methods are bound to
the data (i.e., object oriented programming).

functoolz has a pipe() function to compose, and I really like the |>
operator in F#. I've even implemented |> in Haskell because I prefer
reading left to right, rather than right to left (the $ operator
or nested parens found in Scheme/Lisp).

In python with functoolz:
```python
pipe(data, filter(expr), select(expr), filter(expr), select(expr))
```

In F#/Haskell with a |> operator:
```
data |> filter(expr) |> select(expr) |> filter(expr) |> select(expr)
```
